## Introduction

The project focuses on predicting the energy consumption behavior of prosumers, who both consume and produce energy. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data from diverse sources, it aims to provide accurate forecasts of energy consumption patterns.

## Datasets Used

The project utilizes the following datasets:
- **Client Data**: Information about clients, including county, business type, and product type.
- **Electricity Prices**: Data on electricity prices.
- **Forecast Weather**: Weather forecasts including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Gas Prices**: Historical gas prices data.
- **Historical Weather**: Historical weather data including temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:
- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
- **LightGBM**: Gradient boosting framework for training ensemble models.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment for data exploration and experimentation.
